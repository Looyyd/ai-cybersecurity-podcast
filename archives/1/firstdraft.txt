John: Hello and welcome to The Cyber AI Daily, your daily dose of cybersecurity news. I'm your host, John, and joining me today is our co-host, Jane.

Jane: Hi everyone!

John: Our first headline today is regarding WordPress. Hackers are exploiting a vulnerability in the Elementor Pro plugin, putting millions of WordPress sites at risk. Jane, what can you tell us about this?

Jane: Well John, the exploit allows attackers to create rogue admin accounts and take over websites. WordPress has already released a patch for the vulnerability, but it's important for website owners to update their plugins as soon as possible to stay protected.

John: Thank you, Jane. Our next headline is quite concerning. A playbook leak has exposed Russia's plans for worldwide cyberwar using a technique called Vulkan. Jane, what can you tell us about Vulkan?

Jane: Vulkan is a sophisticated tool that can be used for cyber espionage, data theft, and more. The playbook leaked by the Swiss think tank, CSS, reveals Russia's tactics and objectives for using Vulkan. It's a stark reminder that nation-state cyber threats are a real and present danger.

John: Absolutely. And finally, Elastic has expanded its cloud security capabilities for AWS. Jane, can you tell us more about what this means?

Jane: Elastic has added endpoint security, threat hunting, and custom detection capabilities to its Elasticsearch Service and Elastic Cloud products on AWS. This means users will have even more tools to protect their cloud environments from cyber threats.

John: Thank you, Jane, for that great insight. And that wraps up this episode of The Cyber AI Daily. Join us tomorrow for more cybersecurity news.

John: Welcome to The Cyber AI Daily, your daily source of cybersecurity news. Today we will be discussing the recent exploitation of a security vulnerability in the Elementor Pro website builder plugin for WordPress. This flaw is currently being exploited by unknown threat actors and could potentially impact millions of sites.

Jane: That's right, John. The broken access control vulnerability was discovered and reported by NinTechNet security researcher Jerome Bruandet on March 18, 2023. The vulnerability is found in versions 3.11.6 and earlier and was only recently patched in version 3.11.7, which was released on March 22.

John: The Elementor Pro plugin is estimated to be used on over 12 million sites, making this a high-severity flaw. If successfully exploited, it would allow an authenticated attacker to take over a WordPress site that has WooCommerce enabled. The attacker would then have the ability to create an account with administrator privileges or upload malicious plugins to exploit the site even further.

Jane: Patchstack, a cybersecurity company, has issued an alert warning users of the ongoing exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. It is important for users of the plugin to update to version 3.11.7 or 3.12.0, which is the latest version, as soon as possible to mitigate potential threats.

John: This isn't the first time we've seen such vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins. Just last week, a critical bug was discovered in the WooCommerce Payments plugin that allowed unauthenticated attackers to gain administrator access to vulnerable sites.

Jane: That's right, John. It's important for users to keep their plugins and software up to date to avoid such vulnerabilities. As always, we urge our listeners to stay informed and vigilant in their cybersecurity practices.

John: That's all for today's episode of The Cyber AI Daily, your daily source of cybersecurity news. Tune in tomorrow for more updates and insights.

John: Welcome to The Cyber AI Daily, your daily source of cybersecurity news. Today we are discussing a major leak that exposed Russia's plans for worldwide cyberwar. 

Jane: Recently, confidential documents from the Russian contractor NTC Vulkan were leaked, revealing the grand plans of Russian military and intelligence agencies to use their cyberwar capabilities in disinformation campaigns, hacking operations, critical infrastructure disruption, and control of the Internet.

John: It's very concerning to see how private companies are being used to plan and execute global hacking operations by Russian intelligence agencies. These documents include project plans, software descriptions, instructions, internal emails, and transfer documents from the company.

Jane: The leaked materials further reveal that the Russian contractor conducts training seminars to train hackers on taking over railroad networks and power plants.

John: The most alarming part of the leak is the revelation of the offensive cyber programs internally codenamed "Amezit" and "Skan-V".  The programs enable attacks on critical infrastructure facilities and total information control over specific areas. These programs include tools to derail trains or paralyze airport computers and automate cyberattacks, making them much easier to plan.

Jane: It's uncertain whether and where these programs were used, but it's evident that the programs were ordered, tested, and paid for. According to the documents, private companies' links to the FSB, GOU and GRU, and the SVR have been exposed. 

John: The leak shows a trail leading to the state hacker group Sandworm, which is responsible for some of the most serious cyberattacks in recent years. They have been targeting the Ukrainian capital and previously linked to GRU. 

Jane: It's clear that the dangers of Russia's cyberwar capabilities are immense, and people need to be aware of it. The anonymous source who leaked the docs to the media shared that the Russian invasion of Ukraine had motivated the source to make the documents public.

John: That's all for today's segment of The Cyber AI Daily. Stay safe, and we'll be back tomorrow with more news on cybersecurity.

John: Hello and welcome to The Cyber AI Daily, your daily update on cybersecurity news. Today, we are excited to discuss Elastic's newest development in Cloud Security Posture Management for AWS. According to Elastic, their new capabilities in Cloud Security Posture Management for AWS, container workload security and cloud vulnerability management will help organizations with unified visibility across all their cloud resources, as well as offering comprehensive cloud-native application protection for AWS. 

Jane: And this development comes at a crucial time when cloud security is becoming a top priority for organizations all over the world. Over 85% of organizations are now operating on cloud platforms, and 95% of new digital workloads are deployed on cloud-native platforms.

John: The new suite of Elastic's cloud security capabilities includes cloud workload protection, container workload protection, and cloud vulnerability management. With runtime analytics, posture management dashboards, and out-of-the-box integrations, cloud security teams will have the right tools at their disposal.

Jane: And not only that, the new Cloud Security Posture Management feature will enable cloud security teams to continuously detect and remediate misconfigurations across workloads in AWS, providing organizations with real-time, unified visibility across their environments in a single interface.

John: And the benefits of this unified visibility are immeasurable. Organizations no longer have to pivot between multiple dashboards, and that means security teams can benefit from a streamlined approach to cloud security operations.

Jane: And with the increasing need for secure cloud solutions, Elastic's new capabilities are set to improve attack surface visibility, reduce vendor complexity, and accelerate remediation.

John: And that's all for today's episode. Thanks for tuning in, and we'll see you tomorrow with more cybersecurity news on The Cyber AI Daily.
